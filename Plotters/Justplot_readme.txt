This application is designed to plot Raman/PL spectrum and draw fitted curves on it. 

The input data should be in a .txt format containing two columns:
Energy/Raman Shift, Intensity

How to use:
Select .txt data files.
Select the folder where the output .png files will be saved.
Choose the desired Plot Type to adjust the x-y labels accordingly.
Add the plot title (to distinguish between files, the title will automatically be added the file's name at first).
Enter the color of the plot.
(Choosen) 
Before you add curves to the plot, you should select the data file first.
Choose curve type and enter the "amp, center, width" for Gaussian and Lorentz;"amp, center, sigma, gamma" for Voigt.
Click 'Add Curve', you can see the parameters below. (You can modify or delete them by clicking on the parameters)
After adding as many curves as you want, exit the 'Add Curve' window and click 'Generate Plots'.
	
The picture will be saved in .png and named as same as the data file.
So before you generate plots using the same data, rename the picture if you want to keep.
