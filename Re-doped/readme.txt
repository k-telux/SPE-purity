X (Position X), Y (Position Y), Wavenumber/Raman Shift, Intensity

How to use:
Choose the .txt data file.
Select the folder where the output .png files will be saved.
Enter the minimum and maximum values for the Wavenumber/Raman Shift.
Choose the desired Plot Type to adjust the x-y labels accordingly.

Point Type:
max: Plots the spectrum with the highest intensity points.
min: Plots the spectrum with the lowest intensity points.
given: Allows you to input specific X/Y values to plot a particular point's spectrum.
